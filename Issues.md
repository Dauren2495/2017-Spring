### Q&A

If you have any questions, please create an
[issue](https://github.com/KAIST-IS521/2017-Spring/issues).
When an issue is opened, course staffs will mark the issue with an appropriate
label based on its contents.

When describing your problem, it is always a good idea to use Markdown
references to pinpoint your commit and line numbers (if you are dealing with
public repository). See
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23821235/how-to-link-to-specific-line-number-on-github
for more information.
